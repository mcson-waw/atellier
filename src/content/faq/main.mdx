questions:
  - question: "Is this therapy?"
    answer: "No. I'm not a licensed therapist, and what I offer isn't clinical treatment. This is psychoeducation and skills training—helping you understand how stress works and giving you practical tools to manage it. If you're dealing with trauma, severe mental health conditions, or crisis situations, please work with a licensed mental health professional."
  - question: "What if I don't know what I need?"
    answer: "That's completely normal. Most people come with a general sense that something's off, not a clear diagnosis or specific request. The initial sessions are designed to help us figure out together what would be most helpful for you."
  - question: "How is this different from meditation apps or self-help books?"
    answer: "Apps and books are wonderful resources, but they're one-size-fits-all. What I offer is personalized guidance based on your specific patterns, challenges, and goals. Plus, there's something about having another human to talk things through with that no app can replicate."
  - question: "I'm skeptical about mindfulness—isn't it just woo-woo stuff?"
    answer: "I get it. There's a lot of spiritual bypassing and pseudoscience in the wellness space. My approach is grounded in research—neuroscience, psychology, evidence-based practice. No crystals, no chakras, no telling you to just think positive. Just practical, science-backed tools."
  - question: "How quickly will I see results?"
    answer: "Some people notice shifts immediately—especially in how they relate to their stress, even if the stress itself is still there. Deeper changes typically emerge over weeks or months of consistent practice. This isn't a quick fix; it's building new patterns."
  - question: "What if I can't afford your rates?"
    answer: "Please reach out anyway. I maintain reduced-rate options for those in financial hardship, and I can often point you toward free or low-cost resources if we can't work together directly."
  - question: "Can we work together online?"
    answer: "Absolutely. Most of my clients work with me via video call. The practices translate well to online formats, and it removes geographical barriers. In-person sessions are available in the Warsaw area."
  - question: "What's your cancellation policy?"
    answer: "Life happens. I ask for 24 hours notice when possible, but I understand that emergencies don't follow schedules. Consistent no-shows without communication may affect future scheduling."
