My approach combines **psychoeducation**, **somatic practices**, and **mindfulness-based stress reduction**. Everything I share is rooted in research, but delivered in a way that's accessible and human.

## What this looks like in practice

We start where you are. No assumptions, no one-size-fits-all programs. Some people need to understand the *why* behind their stress before anything else makes sense. Others want practical tools they can use immediately. Most want both.

Sessions might include:

- **Understanding your stress patterns** — what triggers you, how you typically respond, and what that tells us about what you need
- **Breath and body practices** — simple, effective techniques for shifting your nervous system state
- **Mindful awareness exercises** — building the skill of noticing without judgment
- **Building your personal toolkit** — identifying which approaches work best for your life, your schedule, your temperament

## The goal

Not to eliminate stress—that's neither possible nor desirable. But to change your relationship with it. To build capacity. To find more moments of ease in your days.

To feel more like yourself again.
