## The free consultation

Before any commitment, we'll have a 20-minute conversation. This is your chance to ask questions, share what you're experiencing, and get a sense of whether this approach resonates with you.

**No sales pressure. No obligation.**

If we're not the right fit, I'll do my best to point you toward resources that might serve you better.

## What's included in every option

- Evidence-based psychoeducation and practices
- A judgment-free space to explore
- Practical tools you can use immediately
- Flexibility to adjust as we learn what works for you

## A note on pricing

I believe this work should be accessible. If cost is a barrier, please reach out anyway. I maintain a limited number of reduced-rate spots and can often find a way to work together.

Your wellbeing shouldn't depend on your wallet.
