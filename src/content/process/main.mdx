## This isn't therapy

I want to be clear about what I offer. I'm not a therapist, and this isn't clinical treatment. If you're dealing with trauma, severe anxiety, depression, or other mental health conditions, working with a licensed mental health professional should be your first step.

What I offer is **psychoeducation and skills training**—helping you understand how stress affects your mind and body, and giving you practical tools to work with it.

Think of it as a course in yourself, with a guide who's walked similar paths.

## What to expect

**Pace**: We move at your speed. Some people want intensive work; others need time between sessions to integrate. Both are valid.

**Format**: Sessions are typically 60-90 minutes, conducted online or in person (Warsaw area). Frequency depends on your needs and goals.

**Between sessions**: You'll have practices to explore, but nothing overwhelming. The goal is sustainable change, not more items on your to-do list.

**Communication**: Questions come up between sessions. You'll have ways to reach out when you need clarification or support.

## A note on readiness

There's no perfect time to start. You don't need to be in crisis, but you also don't need to have everything figured out. You just need to be curious—about yourself, about what's possible.

If something in these words resonates, that's enough to begin.
