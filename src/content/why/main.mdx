Maybe you've been pushing through for so long that you've forgotten what ease feels like. Maybe the strategies that used to work have stopped working. Maybe you're just tired of feeling like you're constantly running on empty.

None of this means there's something wrong with you. It means your nervous system has been working overtime, doing its best to protect you. But there are gentler, more sustainable ways to move through the world.

**You don't have to figure this out alone.**

The work I offer isn't about fixing what's broken—because you're not broken. It's about understanding how your mind and body respond to stress, learning to recognize your patterns, and building a more grounded relationship with yourself.

This is psychoeducation rooted in science, delivered with warmth. No jargon, no judgment, no quick fixes that don't actually fix anything.

Just practical tools, honest conversations, and the permission to take things at your own pace.
